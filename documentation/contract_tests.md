### Overview

<img alt="Contract Tests" src="https://specmatic.in//wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Contract-as-test.png" />

As seen in "[getting started](/getting_started.html#provider-side---contract-as-a-test)" Specmatic is able to leverage your API Specifications as "Contract Tests" to verify if your application is adhering the specification. This step is critical in making sure that your application / provider is honouring its side of the contract in the "Contract Driven Development" process just like how consumers build against a smart mock that is based the same OpenAPI Specification.

### Specmatic Contract Test - Command Line

Create a file named "employees.yaml" and copy below content into it. This is an API Specification for an employee service which allows fetching and updating employee details.

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0

                    name: Jill Doe
                    department: Engineering
                    designation: Director
components:
  schemas:
    Employee:
      title: Employee
      type: object
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - department
        - designation
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        name:
          type: string
        department:
          type: string
        designation:
          type: string
```

Here is a sample application that is is implementing this specification. You can run a curl command on this URL to see the sample data.

`https://my-json-server.typicode.com/znsio/specmatic/employees/`

Let us now run the ```employees.yaml``` as a test against the above sample application.

```{{ site.spec_cmd }} test --testBaseURL https://my-json-server.typicode.com employees.yaml```

The results should end with below text.

```Tests run: 4, Successes: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0```

And if you further analyse the test logs for ```PUT /znsio/specmatic/employees/{id}```, you will notice that specmatic sent the value 10 and did not generate a random value. How did this happen?
* Specmatic is able to correlate the request and response examples based on naming convention
* In the ```employees.yaml``` you will notice several examples for the employeeId parameter each with a different name, these same names are again used in the response examples also. This is what is helping Specmatic tie the request and response together
* In OpenAPI, while it is possible to define several possible responses for an opeeration, it is not possible to define which input generates which response. This is the reason why Specmatic has to depend on the example names

### Externalising examples / test cases

Sometimes it may not be possible to keep the test cases as examples inline within the OpenAPI YAML file. Example: It may impact readability of specification, you may have different set of examples by environment, etc.

In these circumstances you can leverage **Specmatic's [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) based Domain Specific Language (DSL)** to define the examples in a tabular format externally thereby keeping the OpenAPI spec itself unaffected.

Here is an example where we have split the ["employees.yaml" we saw in the above section](/documentation/contract_tests.html#specmatic-contract-test---command-line) into two files in the same directory.
* ```employees-without-examples.yaml``` - OpenAPI Spec file without the examples
* ```employees.spec``` - Specmatic Gherkin Spec which includes the employees.yaml and adds the examples for each path, operation and response thereby making it easily readable

**```employees-without-examples.yaml```**

**```employees.spec```**
```gherkin
Feature: Employees API

  Background:
    Given openapi ./employees-without-examples.yaml

  Scenario Outline: Create Employee
    When POST /znsio/specmatic/employees
    Then status 201
    Examples:
      | id | name     | department  | designation |
      | 70 | Jill Doe | Engineering | Director    |

  Scenario Outline: Get Employee Success
    When GET /znsio/specmatic/employees/(id:number)
    Then status 200
    Examples:
      | id | name     | department  | designation         |
      | 10 | Jane Doe | Engineering | Engineering Manager |

  Scenario Outline: Get Employee Not Found Error
    When GET /znsio/specmatic/employees/100
    Then status 404

  Scenario Outline: Update Employee Success
    When PUT /znsio/specmatic/employees/10
    Then status 200
    Examples:
      | id | (REQUEST-BODY)                                                                             |
      | 10 | { "id": 10, "name": "Jill Doe", "department": "Engineering", "designation": "Director" } |
```

Let us now run the ```employees.spec``` which is referring to / including the ```employees.yaml``` as a test against the above sample application.

```{{ site.spec_cmd }} test --testBaseURL https://my-json-server.typicode.com employees.spec```

The results will be exactly the same as the previous run.

```Tests run: 4, Successes: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0```

Let us understand Specmatic Gherkin DSL in detail.
* **Background** - We are including the OpenAPI specification file in the [Background](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#background) section of the spec.
  * The entire spec file is bound to this OpenAPI Specification.
  * One OpenAPI Spec can be referenced by any number of Specmatic Gherkin spec files. However within a Specmatic Gherkin spec file we can only reference one OpenAPI specification file.
  * Relative and absolute paths are supported.
* **Scenario Outline** - [Scenario Outline](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#scenario-outline) should adhere to below **Specmatic** DSL (Http method, http status code etc. are keywords specific to Specmatic DSL in addition to the standard [Gherkin keywords](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#keywords))
```
Scenario Outline: <SCENARIO_OUTLINE_NAME>
    When <OPERATION / HTTP METHOD> <PATH>
    Then status <HTTP_STATUS_CODE>
```
Specmatic validates each scenario to check if it is part of the OpenAPI Specification.
* **Examples** - As per [Gherkin reference](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#scenario-outline) - "the Scenario Outline is run once for each row in the Examples section beneath it (not counting the first header row)". Each column in the table represents the fields / parameters in the employees-without-examples.yaml OpenAPI Specification file. Please note that Specmatic validates your examples for datatype correctness against the specification. So this file will not go out of sync with the Specification.
* **RESQUEST-BODY** - This is a keyword that is specific to Specmatic DSL that allows us to send the entire request body instead of adding each parameter as a column in the table. Example: "**Update Employee Success" scenario
* Add examples only where necessary, Specmatic can fill in the rest with auto generated values
  * Scenario "**Get Employee Success**" - The path parameter id is a placeholder and the value for the same is the example row
  * Scenario "**Get Employee Not Found Error**" - We have not added any examples because the value for the id parameter is already in the path instead of having a placeholder
  * Scenario "**Update Employee Success**" - We have not added response examples, however Specmatic will still validate the response against the schema in our OpenAPI Specification

We can add as many rows as necesary for our test cases. Example:

```gherkin
  Scenario Outline: Get Employee Success
    When GET /znsio/specmatic/employees/(number:id)
    Then status 200
    Examples:
      | id | name     | department  | designation         |
      | 10 | Jane Doe | Engineering | Engineering Manager |
      | 40 | Jill Doe | Engineering | Principal Engineer  |
```

### Boundary Condition Testing

In the above example, we only ran the happy path test cases. What if we send an number to a boolean parameter? What if we send a null to a non-nullable parameter? What if we do not send a mandatory parameter? How does the application handle these errors? Input validation is an important aspect of your api security strategy ([OWASP reference]((https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html))).

Specmatic can help you verify / assess such boundary condition behavior and the associated error handling in your application. Let us run the Specmatic tests with the ```SPECMATIC_GENERATIVE_TESTS``` environment variable set to true.

```export SPECMATIC_GENERATIVE_TESTS=true```

```{{ site.spec_cmd }} test --testBaseURL https://my-json-server.typicode.com employees.yaml```

Earlier for the same input we saw 4 tests and all of which were successful. This time around you will see a total of 26 tests, of which 21 are failires

```Tests run: 26, Successes: 5, Failures: 21, Errors: 0```

Exercise: Analyse the logs to understand what input validations need to be added to the application.

Demo: [Video](https://youtu.be/U5Agz-mvYIU?t=216)

### JUnit Output From The Command

You can get the JUnit output from the Specmatic command using an extra parameter.

`{{ site.spec_cmd }} --testBaseURL https://my-json-server.typicode.com --junitReportDir ./test-output`

The command will create JUnit test xml output in the specified directory which you can then include as part of CI pipeline results etc.

### When The API Does Not Match The API Specification

As we saw earlier in this page, the [sample application](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/znsio/specmatic/employees/) is adhering to the ```employees.yaml``` OpenAPI Specification.

Now let us experiment by making some changes to the dataypes in the ```employees.yaml``` and observe the error responses.

Examples:
* Change the datatype of ```designation``` to integer in scheme component Employee - You will notice that Specmatic will complain that your examples are not as per the Specification
* Now lets update all the examples for ```designation``` to value ```1``` - Now Specmatic will run the test and you should see a single failure

We encourage you to try more such modifications to the specification such as adding / removing parameters, updating datatypes, etc. This will give you picture of how Contract Tests work.

Note: If you modify the request, it's possible that the application will respond with a 404 or 500, and you may not see anything more interesting than a mismatched status. But if you modify any response structure in the contract, leaving the request intact, e.g. change an integer to a string or vice versa, the application will send recognize the requests, send response back that do not match the contract which you have modified, and you will see interesting error feedback.

### Declaring Contracts In Configuration

In the last example, we ran run contract tests above by passing the contract path to Specmatic. The drawback here is that the command is not easily machine parseable. It will not be easy for tools to find out which contract is being run as test on which service, and do further analysis. Updating the command to add more contracts will also be more error prone.

So instead:

* Create a file named specmatic.json. 

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "provider": "git",
      "repository": "https://github.com/your-username-or-org/your-repo.git",
      "test": [
        "path/to/employees.yaml"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

* Create a git repository and push the employees.yaml contract into it.
* Update the value of "repository" to the url of the git repo. This should be a url that could be used by git checkout.
* Update the contract path in "test" to the relative path of employees.yaml within the git repository.

Specmatic will use the git command to checkout the git repository provided in specmatic.json. So make sure that the `git` command works on your laptop.

On the command line, `cd` into the directory containing specmatic.json.

Run this command: `{{ site.spec_cmd }} --testBaseURL https://my-json-server.typicode.com`

Note that no contracts are passed to Specmatic. Since no contracts have been passed, Specmatic looks for specmatic.json in the current working directory, checks out the contract repo, and runs the specified contracts as contract tests.

Since Specmatic uses specmatic.json in the current working directory, it's important to use `cd` into the directory containing specmatic.json. For Java projects, specmatic.json should be in the same directory as the pom.xml or build.gradle file.

Since Specmatic uses git under-the-hood, any authentication requirements of your git server will be handled by the underlying git command.

Note:
1. The value of "repository" is the git repository in which the contracts are declared. It can be any git repo, not just github.
2. The value of "test" is a list of contract paths, relative to the repository root, which should be run as contract tests.
3. You may declare multiple contracts in the "test" list.
4. "sources" holds a list. You may declare multiple sources if required. However we recommend using a single contract repository to be shared across your organisation, or ecosystem within the organisation (if your org is large).

### The Java Helper For Java Projects

For Java projects, you can use the Java helper that ships with Specmatic.

Add the following dependencies to your pom.xml file.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>in.specmatic</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit5-support</artifactId>
    <version>{{ site.latest_release }}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
    <version>5.8.2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Add a class that inherits from SpecmaticJUnitSupport. See how this is done [here](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-api/blob/main/src/test/java/com/store/ContractTests.java).

In it, set the "host" and "port" properties to tell Specmatic where to find the application. You can also start the application in that class.

Add specmatic.json at the project root, as described in the previous section.

SpecmaticJUnitSupport is a dynamic JUnit5 test. It will read the contracts from specmatic.json, and run them.

Since it is a JUnit5 test, you can run it in all the ways you are used to. If you run it in the IDE, you'll see the results in your IDEs GUI. If you run `mvn test`, Surefire will store the results of the contract tests in the JUnit xml output file alongside any other JUnit tests in your project. The same applies to `./gradlew test`.

### Handling Application authentication

If the OpenAPI contract defines API authentication using security schemas, these information will be used by Specmatic when running contract tests. Read more about it on the page on [authentication](authentication.html).

### Contracts In A Mono-Repo

If you are using a mono-repo, in which all the projects in the ecosystem are in the same repository, the contracts used by these projects may also be kept in the same repository.

specmatic.json may look like this:

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "provider": "git",
      "test": [
        "contracts/path/to/employees.yaml"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that "repository" is missing. Specamtic will look for the contract in the git repository containing specmatic.json. It's presumed that specmatic.json would be in a git repository, as the project would have to be pushed into some git repository.

### Authentication In CI For HTTPS Git Source

Specmatic does a checkout of the git repository given in specmatic.json using the git command. On your laptop, the git command will take care of authentication and prompt you for a password. But a build on a CI server runs headless without no chance for a user to enter credentials, so the git checkout fails when it gets an authentication failure from the repository.

Instead, Specmatic can do the checkout using OAuth2 authentication, which is also supported by most git providers.

Add a key named "auth" to specmatic.json, as seen in the example below.

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "bearer-file": "bearer.txt"
  },
  "sources": [
    {
      "provider": "git",
      "repository": "https://github.com/your-username-or-org/your-repo.git",
      "test": [
        "path/to/employees.yaml"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In CI, the necessary oauth2 token must be fetched and stored in a file named bearer.txt (as configured) side-by-side with specmatic.json, before running contract tests.

If you are using Microsoft Azure as both your git provider as well as CI, you can use a secret build variable named System.AccessToken, provided by Microsoft Azure, as your OAuth2 bearer token. Before running the tests, use a script to place the value of this variable in a file. For example:

```yaml
# Sample azure pipeline snippet
steps:
  - bash: |
      echo $(System.AccessToken) > bearer.txt
    displayName: Create auth token file
  - bash: |
      mvn test
```

You could also use an environment variable to pass the token.

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "bearer-environment-variable": "BEARER"
  },
  "sources": [
    {
      "provider": "git",
      "repository": "https://github.com/your-username-or-org/your-repo.git",
      "test": [
        "path/to/employees.yaml"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Again, using an example for Microsoft Azure:

```yaml
# Sample azure pipeline snippet
steps:
  - bash: |
      mvn test
    env:
      BEARER: $(System.AccessToken)
```

We have provided samples for Azure, but the same can be done easily in any build system.

 Note that if you are using different systems for git and CI, the two will not be integrated. The first step is to fetch the OAuth2 token from the git repo. The second step is to create the file or environment variable as described above, and finally, you may run the contract tests.

### Authentication In CI For SSH Git Source

You can also use an ssh url as your git source. Take the help of your DevOps team to generate SSH keys locally and on your CI server, and place the local and CI public keys in .ssh/authorized_keys your git server. This will enable the git command to handle authentication seamlessly via SSH authentication.

### Examples For WSDL Contracts

A WSDL contract cannot hold examples within the contract. The format does not support it.

We can instead add examples to a companion file. The companion file should be in the same directory as the wsdl file. It would look like this:

```gherkin
Feature: WSDL Companion file
  Background:
    Given wsdl ./soap-contract-file.wsdl

  Scenario: Add user
    When POST /soap-service-path
    Then status 200

    Examples:
    | (REQUEST-BODY)        | SOAPAction | Any other headers... |
    | <soapenv>...</soapenv> | "/addUser" | header values        |
```

(REQUEST-BODY) contains the request body in a single line, SOAPAction contains the value value of the SOAPAction header, and additional columns must be included for each header sent by the SOAP service.

### Programmtically executing Specmatic Contract as Tests

If your building your application in a JVM based language, you can run Specmatic Contract Tests programmatically just like any other JUnit test and also get similar feedback within your IDE.

Add Specmatic JUnit Support Jar dependency.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>in.specmatic</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit5-support</artifactId>
    <version>{{ site.latest_release }}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Also add the junit5 dependency so that we can use the ```BeforeAll``` and ```AfterAll``` annotations.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
    <version>5.8.2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

No we need to extend ```SpecmaticJUnitSupport``` to run Contract Tests programmatically. Specmatic will locate the API Specifications to run as a test based on the condifurations in your [```specmatic.json```](/documentation/specmatic_json.html) file. All you need to additionally provide is the ```host``` and ```port``` where your application is running.

```java
public class ContractTests extends SpecmaticJUnitSupport {
    @BeforeAll
    public static void setUp() {
        System.setProperty("host", "localhost");
        System.setProperty("port", "8080");
    }
}
```

Here is a complete [Specmatic Contract Test example](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-api/blob/main/src/test/java/com/store/ContractTests.java) for a Springboot application.

### Referring to local specificatons

If you want to temoporarily refer to API specifications on your local machine please use system property ```contractPaths```.

```java
@BeforeAll
public static void setUp() {
    File apiContract = new File("<path to API specification>/orders-api-v1.yaml");
    System.setProperty("contractPaths", apiContract.getAbsolutePath());
    System.setProperty("host", "localhost");
    System.setProperty("port", "8080");
}
```
